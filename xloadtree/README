This file contains the comments that should go into
the code but are omitted from javascript for what
are usually cultural reasons.

xtree2.js has been modified from the original
upstream version to support connections to multiple
ports on a single server.  This was done by putting
both the protocol and the port, if any, into the
cookie name used to support persistence.
Technically, the protocol implies the port but this
is easier and should work just as well.

While it is not ordinarily a good idea to modify
upstream sources, in this case the the upstream
license was changed in more recent releases to the
Apache license.  Since this is incompabible with
the GPLv2, the license of the xtree2.js code as
used and the license in PPA as a whole, it seems
reasonable that we will not be able to use newer
upstream releases and so we may as well go ahead
and modify the code.
